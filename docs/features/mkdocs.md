## Example workflow

!!! example "How to create your own documentation"
    1. **Create a new markdown file in the `docs/` folder**
        For example:
        ```bash
        touch docs/how_to_start.md
        ```

    2. **Add this file to the navigation in [mkdocs.yml](https://github.com/python-boilerplate/uv-template/blob/main/mkdocs.yml):**
        ```yaml title="mkdocs.yml"
        nav:
          - Home: index.md
          - How to Start: how_to_start.md
        ```

    3. **Start the local server to preview the result:**
        ```bash
        make serve
        # or
        uv run mkdocs serve
        ```

    4. **Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser and check that the page appears in the menu.**

    5. **Edit markdown files â€” changes are picked up automatically.**
