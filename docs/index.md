## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important

!!! warning "!"
    This is a boilerplate template.
    After cloning or generating your project, remember to:

    - Update your project name in `pyproject.toml` and `docker-compose.yml`
    - Replace this README with documentation specific to your project
    - Configure environment variables in `.env.development` and `.env.production`
    - Customize the Makefile commands as needed for your project

## ‚ö° Quick Start

!!! info "Step 1: Clone the repository"
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/python-boilerplate/uv-template
    cd uv-template
    ```

!!! info "Step 2: Initialize the project"
    ```bash
    make init
    ```
    This will install dependencies (with creating virtual environment) and set up pre-commit hooks

!!! info "Step 3: Set up environment variables"
    ```bash
    cp example.env .env.development
    # Edit .env.development as needed
    ```

!!! info "Step 4: Run the application"
    ```bash
    make run
    ```
