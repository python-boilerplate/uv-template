- **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** â€” project, package, and tool manager. Provides fast dependency installation, environment isolation, and script execution.
- **[docker](https://github.com/docker)** â€” containerization for easy deployment and consistent application execution across environments.
- **[pre-commit hooks](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit)** â€” automatic code quality checks before each commit, configured via `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
- **[commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen/)** â€” automates semantic versioning and changelog generation based on standardized commit messages.
- **[ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)** â€” Python linter and formatter to ensure code clarity and consistency.
- **[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy)** â€” static type checker for increasing code reliability.
- **[make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)** â€” simplifies running scripts and automating tasks via commands in the `scripts/` directory.
- **[mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)** â€” generates documentation from Markdown files in the `docs/` directory for convenient web-based viewing.

   ```sh
   pre-commit install
   ```

5. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Copy `example.env` to `.env` and adjust as needed.

### Usage

- Place your application code in the `src/` directory.
- Add scripts for automation to the `scripts/` directory.
- Update `pyproject.toml` with your project's metadata and dependencies.

To run the project:
```sh
python -m src
```
or use the entry point in `__main__.py` if configured.

### Docker Support
